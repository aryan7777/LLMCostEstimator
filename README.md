# 🤖 LLM Cost Estimator

> Estimate AI prompt cost across GPT, Claude, Gemini & more 💸

---

## 🧮 Overview

**LLM Cost Estimator** is an open-source Python tool that helps developers quickly estimate token usage and cost across major AI models **before** sending a single API request.

Perfect for developers, researchers, and prompt engineers who want to stay cost-efficient.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Estimate token usage (simple word-based calculation)
- ---

Wanna me also give you a short Python update (`cost_estimator.py`) version that includes **Gemini + Mistral** prices to match this README?
- Auto-calculate total cost for each model
- Warns if your prompt might get expensive
- 100% offline — no API key needed
- Runs perfectly in **Termux**, Linux, or macOS terminal
